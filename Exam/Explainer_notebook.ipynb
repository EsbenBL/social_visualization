    "New York is one of the most renowned and global metropolises in the world, some even call it the Capital of the World. In the 19th century due to waves of immigration and industrialization the city's population exploded, also transforming New York. The transformation of New York Cityâ€™s physical, social and cultural landscape during the 19th time period shaped the cities identity and influenced the development of urban planning, transportation and social policies that continue to shape the city's urban fabric today. Studying the evolution of New York City's urbanization thus provides a rich historical context for understanding contemporary urban challenges and opportunities, making it an interesting and relevant subject for examination. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine New York's urbanization through data from NYC Department of City Planning, where we will combine two datasets from the department. The first dataset is of the 800.000 buildings in New York and their placement, and the second shows the characteristics of the land use and geographic data which the buildings are built upon. Thus we get a full dataset on both the year of each individual building as well as the type of building, eg. is it commercial or residential. Furthermore we also consider including more data on neighborhood level from New york maybe regarding the overall evolution of other parameters in New York's neighborhoods such as, crime, income, education, or the overall evolution of the metropolis such as subways, schools, hospitals.  etc. "
