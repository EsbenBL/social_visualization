    "Let's paint the picture! A boat filled with tired but hopeful families glides across the still morning waters. They have all left their old homes for the promises and opportunities of the new world. In the distance, through the mist, a statue the size of a skyscraper breaks through the morning fog. The mood among the seaworn travellers brightens, realizing that they have finally arrived at their destination. Soon after, a skyline of actual skyscrapers paints the horizon and the bustling sounds of city life fill the air. Sounds familiar?\n",

    "New York City is undeniably one of - if not *the* most influential and renowned city in western society. In many ways, the city incapsulates the idea The American Dream, with its buzzing streets, opportune business life, and rich cultural scene, spawning sayings like *\"if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere\"*. Pop cultural references to New York City is omnipresent in western movies, music, and art and each year [millions of turists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_international_visitors) from all over the world flock to the city see all the \"familiar\" places in real life. *The City that never sleeps*, *the Capital of the World*, *the Big Apple* - New York City has earned itself many nicknames. The City has the [second highest GDP in the world](http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2020.html), and continues to be [the largest city in the USA for over 200 years](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/05v11n2/0512glae.pdf) with a population of around 8.5 million people today. Professor of economics at Harvard University, Edward L. Glaeser, states that *\"While Boston's history is one of ongoing crises and reinvention (Glaeser 2005), New York's is one of almost unbroken triumph\"* (Glaeser 2005:1). But what could be the explanation for NYC's urbanizational triumph the last 200 years?\n",

    "Just as the history of hopeful immigrants arriving to New York City on boats from Europe is a central part of the city's identity, so are it's iconic skyscraper. The physical appearance of the city have come to shape it's economic, social and cultural fabric. Take for instance this very popular picture from 1932 of a band of construction workers taking their lunch break on a beam floating high above the streets of New York. The picture on the right shows the characters from the hugely popular sitcome *Friends*, doing more of less the same thing.\n",

    "Answering this question is a complex task, but we seek to give the reader a more granular understanding of the urbanisational development of NYC by using visualizations and statistics, and as a result maybe also come a closer to answering the question of NYC’s 200-year triumph. We hope that by presenting these essential parts of NYC history we can show patterns in the overall history of New York thus pushing the boundaries for urban knowledge. We will map two important parts of development in the history of NYC, its commercializational development and its migrational development. We look into the commercialisational development of NYC, as we want to understand better how NYC has developed to become such a rich city with the second highest GDP in the world. We look into migrational development as a lot of the cultural and historical identity of NYC is inadvertently tied to its status as a city build by migrants (https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-7-2016.pdf). Thus we hope by visualizing patterns in the urbanisational development of NYC with commercialization and migration as our points of interest, we become able to see the historical effects through time, while understanding contemporary NYC better. \n",

This dataset gives us information on the use of the land plot (*landuse*) and year for when the construction of the buildings on the landplots was completed(*yearbuilt*).  Using this dataset we can map the development of NYC from 1800-2020 start to finish.\n",

    "The PLUTO dataset also has some limitations. One limitation is that the dataset only have data for buildings and land plots used today. Thus we do not have information on for example buildings which were demolished and rebuild or whether the land was once residential and then changed to commercial. A second limitation is regarding the variable *yearbuilt*, were it is important to be skeptical as the data dictionary states that the buildings construction was not neccesarily done on that specific indicated year, as within the timeframe 1910 and 1985 a majority of the construction years are in years ending in 5 or 0 (Pluto Data Dictionary: 35). A third limitation is that a large amount of buildings which was build between 1800 and the early 1900s are stated to be between 1899 and 1901 (Pluto Data Dictionary: 35). Acknowledging these limitations we still argue that the data represent an opportunity to see New York evolve through time.  \n",

    "Our third and final dataset we use to map the ethnicity throughout contemporary NYC. This data we got using [the United States Census Bureaus API](#https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html), this API is rather large with numerous dataset on all of The United States of America. We use a dataset gathered as part of the [American Community Survey (ACS)](#https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs), they gather data on the communities of USA to help officials. ACS have four surveys dataset: [1-year estimates, 1-year supplemental estimates, 3-year estimates and 5-year estimates](#https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html). For this project we use the [5-year estimates](#https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) because it gives the most reliable and granular data. The 5-year estimates dataset is a very big survey for all of USA, while at the same time being granular to block group level, which we specifically use to investigate the contemporary neighbourhood compositions of NYC. We are interested in the *race* variables of the survey on a neighbourhood level, but one should also be a bit cautious. The *race* variable is selfreport and self-identification, so people themselves can choose the group which they identify with, and they can choose multiple ethnicity groups (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race.html). Thus we for example found the *race* variable to give more than 100% of the population in each neighbourhood. As we only want an estimate of the ethnicity spread of the neighborhoods of NYC we argue the data still probably represent the overall ethnic tendencies of the neighborhoods. \n",
