    "For a number of years I've been a little bit obsessed with [predictive policing](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/can-predictive-policing-prevent-crime-it-happens). I guess there are various reasons. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I think it's an interesting application of data science. \n",
    "* It connects to popular culture in a big way. Both through TV shows, such as [NUMB3RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)) (it also features in Bones ... or any of the CSI), and also any number of movies, my favorite of which has to be [Minority report](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/).\n",
    "* Predictive policing is also big business. Companies like [PredPol](https://www.predpol.com), [Palantir](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd), and many other companies offer their services law enforcement by analyzing crime data. \n",
    "* It hints at the dark sides of Data Science. In these algorithms, concepts like [bias, fairness, and accountability](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/artificial-intelligence-is-now-used-predict-crime-is-it-biased-180968337/) become incredibly important when the potential outcome of an algorithm is real people going to prison.  \n",
